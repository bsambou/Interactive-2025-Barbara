<p>
OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
</p>
<p>
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
</p>
<p>
<p>Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,</p>
<p>With loss of Eden, till one greater Man</p>
<p>Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,</p>
<p>Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top</p>
<p>Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire</p>
<p>That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,</p>
<p>In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth</p>
<p>Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill</p>
<p>Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd</p>
<p>Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence</p>
<p>Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,</p>
<p>That with no middle flight intends to soar</p>
<p>Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues</p>
<p>Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.</p>
<p>And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer</p>
<p>Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,</p>
<p>Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first</p>
<p>Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread</p>
<p>Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss</p>
<p>And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark</p>
<p>Illumin, what is low raise and support;</p>
<p>That to the highth of this great Argument</p>
<p> may assert Eternal Providence,</p>
<p>And justifie the wayes of God to men.</p>

<br></br>

<p>Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view</p>
<p>Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause</p>
<p>Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,</p>
<p>Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off</p>
<p>From thir Creator, and transgress his Will</p>
<p>For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?</p>
<p>Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt?</p>
<p>Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile</p>
<p>Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd</p>
<p>The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride</p>
<p>Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host</p>
<p>Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring</p>
<p>To set himself in Glory above his Peers,</p>
<p>He trusted to have equal'd the most High,</p>
<p>If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim</p>
<p>Against the Throne and Monarchy of God</p>
<p>Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud</p>
<p>With vain attempt.   Him the Almighty Power</p>
<p>Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie</p>
<p>With hideous ruine and combustion down</p>
<p>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell</p>
<p>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,</p>
<p>Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.</p>
<p>Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night</p>
<p>To mortal men, he with his horrid crew</p>
<p>Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe</p>
<p>Confounded though immortal: But his doom</p>
<p>Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought</p>
<p>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain</p>
<p>Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes</p>
<p>That witness'd huge affliction and dismay</p>
<p>Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:</p>
<p>At once as far as Angels kenn he views</p>
<p>The dismal Situation waste and wilde,</p>
<p>A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round</p>
<p>As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames</p>
<p>No light, but rather darkness visible</p>
<p>Serv'd onely to discover sights of woe,</p>
<p>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace</p>
<p>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes</p>
<p>That comes to all; but torture without end</p>
<p>Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed</p>
<p>With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:</p>
<p>For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained</p>
<p>In utter darkness, and thir portion set</p>
<p>As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n</p>
<p>As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.</p>
<p>O how unlike the place from whence they fell!</p>
<p>There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd</p>
<p>With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,</p>
<p>He soon discerns, and weltring by his side</p>
<p>ne next himself in power, and next in crime,</p>
<p>Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd</p>
<p>Beelzebub.   To whom th' Arch-Enemy,</p>
<p>And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words</p>
<p>Breaking the horrid silence thus began.</p>

<br></br>

<p>If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd</p>
<p>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light</p>
<p>Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine</p>
<p>Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,</p>
<p>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope</p>
<p>And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,</p>
<p>Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd</p>
<p>In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest</p>
<p>From what highth fall'n, so much the stronger prov'd</p>
<p>He with his Thunder: and till then who knew</p>
<p>The force of those dire Arms?   yet not for those,</p>
<p>Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage,</p>
<p>Can else inflict, do I repent or change,</p>
<p>Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind</p>
<p>And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,</p>
<p>That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,</p>
<p>And to the fierce contention brought along</p>
<p>Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd</p>
<p>That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,</p>
<p>His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd</p>
<p>In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,</p>
<p>And shook his throne.   What though the field be lost?</p>
<p>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,</p>
<p>And study of revenge, immortal hate,</p>
<p>And courage never to submit or yield:</p>
<p>And what is else not to be overcome?</p>
<p>That Glory never shall his wrath or might</p>
<p>Extort from me.   To bow and sue for grace</p>
<p>With suppliant knee, and deifie his power,</p>
<p>Who from the terrour of this Arm so late</p>
<p>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,</p>
<p>That were an ignominy and shame beneath</p>
<p>This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods</p>
<p>And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,</p>
<p>Since through experience of this great event</p>
<p>In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,</p>
<p>We may with more successful hope resolve</p>
<p>To wage by force or guile eternal Warr</p>
<p>Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,</p>
<p>Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy</p>
<p>Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.</p>

<br></br>

<p>So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,</p>
<p>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:</p>
<p>And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.</p>
<br></br>

<p>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,</p>
<p>That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr</p>
<p>Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds</p>
<p>Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;</p>
<p>And put to proof his high Supremacy,</p>
<p>Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,</p>
<p>Too well I see and rue the dire event,</p>
<p>That with sad overthrow and foul defeat</p>
<p>Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host</p>
<p>In horrible destruction laid thus low,</p>
<p>As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences</p>
<p>Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains</p>
<p>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,</p>
<p>Though all our Glory extinct and happy state</p>
<p>Here swallow'd up in endless misery.</p>
<p>But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now</p>
<p>Of force believe Almighty, since no less</p>
<p>Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)</p>
<p>Have left us this our spirit and strength intire</p>
<p>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,</p>
<p>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,</p>
<p>Or do him mightier service as his thralls</p>
<p>By right of Warr, what e're his business be</p>
<p>Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,</p>
<p>Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;</p>
<p>What can it then avail though yet we feel</p>
<p>Strength undiminisht, or eternal being</p>
<p>To undergo eternal punishment?</p>
<p>Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.</p>

<br></br>

<p>Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable</p>
<p>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,</p>
<p>To do ought good never will be our task,</p>
<p>But ever to do ill our sole delight,</p>
<p>As being the contrary to his high will</p>
<p>Whom we resist.   If then his Providence</p>
<p>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,</p>
<p>Our labour must be to pervert that end,</p>
<p>And out of good still to find means of evil;</p>
<p>Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps</p>
<p>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb</p>
<p>His inmost counsels from thir destind aim.</p>
<p>But see the angry Victor hath recall'd</p>
<p>His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit</p>
<p>Back to the Gates of Heav'n: the Sulphurous Hail</p>
<p>Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid</p>
<p>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice</p>
<p>Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,</p>
<p>Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,</p>
<p>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now</p>
<p>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.</p>
<p>Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,</p>
<p>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.</p>
<p>Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,</p>
<p>The seat of desolation, voyd of light,</p>
<p>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</p>
<p>Casts pale and dreadful?   Thither let us tend</p>
<p>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,</p>
<p>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,</p>
<p>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,</p>
<p>Consult how we may henceforth most offend</p>
<p>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<p>
<p>How overcome this dire Calamity,</p>
<p>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,</p>
<p>If not what resolution from despare.</p>

<br></br>

<p>Thus Satan to his neerest Mate</p>
<p>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes</p>
<p>That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides</p>
<p>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large</p>
<p>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge</p>
<p>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,</p>
<p>Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove,</p>
<p>Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den</p>
<p>By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast</p>
<p>Leviathan, which God of all his works</p>
<p>Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:</p>
<p>Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam</p>
<p>The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,</p>
<p>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,</p>
<p>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind</p>
<p>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night</p>
<p>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:</p>
<p>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay</p>
<p>Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence</p>
<p>Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will</p>
<p>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven</p>
<p>Left him at large to his own dark designs,</p>
<p>That with reiterated crimes he might</p>
<p>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought</p>
<p>Evil to others, and enrag'd might see</p>
<p>How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth</p>
<p>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn</p>
<p>On Man by him seduc't, but on himself</p>
<p>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.</p>
<p>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool</p>
<p>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames</p>
<p>Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld</p>
<p>In billows, leave i'th'midst a horrid Vale.</p>
<p>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight</p>
<p>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air</p>
<p>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land</p>
<p>He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn'd</p>
<p>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;</p>
<p>And such appear'd in hue, as when the force</p>
<p>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill</p>
<p>Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side</p>
<p>Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible</p>
<p>And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,</p>
<p>Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,</p>
<p>And leave a singed bottom all involv'd</p>
<p>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole</p>
<p>Of unblest feet.   Him followed his next Mate,</p>
<p>Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood</p>
<p>As Gods, and by thir own recover'd strength,</p>
<p>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.</p>

<br></br>

<p>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,</p>
<p>Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat</p>
<p>That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom</p>
<p>For that celestial light?   Be it so, since he</p>
<p>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid</p>
<p>What shall be right: fardest from him is best</p>
<p>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream</p>
<p>Above his equals.   Farewel happy Fields</p>
<p>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail</p>
<p>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell</p>
<p>Receive thy new Possessor:   One who brings</p>
<p>A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.</p>
<p>The mind is its own place, and in it self</p>
<p>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.</p>
<p>What matter where, if I be still the same,</p>
<p>And what I should be, all but less then he</p>
<p>Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least</p>
<p>We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built</p>
<p>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:</p>
<p>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce</p>
<p>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:</p>
<p>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.</p>
<p>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,</p>
<p>Th' associates and copartners of our loss</p>
<p>Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,</p>
<p>And call them not to share with us their part</p>
<p>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more</p>
<p>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet</p>
<p>Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?</p>

<br></br>

<p>So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub</p>
<p>Thus answer'd.   Leader of those Armies bright,</p>
<p>Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,</p>
<p>If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge</p>
<p>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft</p>
<p>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge</p>
<p>Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults</p>
<p>Thir surest signal, they will soon resume</p>
<p>New courage and revive, though now they lye</p>
<p>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,</p>
<p>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,</p>
<p>No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.</p>

<br></br>

<p>He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend</p>
<p>Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield</p>
<p>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,</p>
<p>Behind him cast; the broad circumference</p>
<p>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb</p>
<p>Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views</p>
<p>At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole,</p>
<p>Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands,</p>
<p>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.</p>
<p>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine</p>
<p>Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast</p>
<p>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,</p>
<p>He walkt with to support uneasie steps</p>
<p>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps</p>
<p>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime</p>
<p>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;</p>
<p>Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach</p>
<p>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd</p>
<p>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't</p>
<p>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks</p>
<p>In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades</p>
<p>High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge</p>
<p>Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd</p>
<p>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew</p>
<p>Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry,</p>
<p>While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd</p>
<p>The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld</p>
<p>From the safe shore thir floating Carkases</p>
<p>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown</p>
<p>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,</p>
<p>Under amazement of thir hideous change.</p>
<p>He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep</p>
<p>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates</p>
<p>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,</p>
<p>If such astonishment as this can sieze</p>
<p>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place</p>
<p>After the toyl of Battel to repose</p>
<p>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find</p>
<p>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?</p>
<p>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn</p>
<p>To adore the Conquerour?   who now beholds</p>
<p>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood</p>
<p>With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon</p>
<p>His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern</p>
<p>Th' advantage, and descending tread us down</p>
<p>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts</p>
<p>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.</p>
<p>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.</p>

<br></br>

<p>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung</p>
<p>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch</p>
<p>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,</p>
<p>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.</p>
<p>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight</p>
<p>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;</p>
<p>Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd</p>
<p>Innumerable.   As when the potent Rod</p>
<p>Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day</p>
<p>Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud</p>
<p>Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind,</p>
<p>That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung</p>
<p>Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile:</p>
<p>So numberless were those bad Angels seen</p>
<p>Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell</p>
<p>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;</p>
<p>Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear</p>
<p>Of thir great Sultan waving to direct</p>
<p>Thir course, in even ballance down they light</p>
<p>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;</p>
<p>A multitude, like which the populous North</p>
<p>Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass</p>
<p>Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons</p>
<p>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread</p>
<p>Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands.</p>
<p>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band</p>
<p>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood</p>
<p>Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms</p>
<p>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,</p>
<p>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;</p>
<p>Though of thir Names in heav'nly Records now</p>
<p>Be no memorial blotted out and ras'd</p>
<p>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.</p>
<p>Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve</p>
<p>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,</p>
<p>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,</p>
<p>By falsities and lyes the greatest part</p>
<p>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake</p>
<p>God thir Creator, and th' invisible</p>
<p>Glory of him that made them, to transform</p>
<p>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd</p>
<p>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,</p>
<p>And Devils to adore for Deities:</p>
<p>Then were they known to men by various Names,</p>
<p>And various Idols through the Heathen World.</p>
<p>Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last,</p>
<p>Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,</p>
<p>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth</p>
<p>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,</p>
<p>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?</p>
<p>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell</p>
<p>Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix</p>
<p>Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God,</p>
<p>Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd</p>
<p>Among the Nations round, and durst abide</p>
<p>Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd</p>
<p>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd</p>
<p>Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines,</p>
<p>Abominations; and with cursed things</p>
<p>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,</p>
<p>And with thir darkness durst affront his light.</p>
<p>First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood</p>
<p>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,</p>
<p>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud</p>
<p>Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire</p>
<p>To his grim Idol.   Him the Ammonite</p>
<p>Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain,</p>
<p>In Argob and in Basan, to the stream</p>
<p>Of utmost Arnon.   Not content with such</p>
<p>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart</p>
<p>Of Solomon he led by fraud to build</p>
<p>His Temple right against the Temple of God</p>
<p>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove</p>
<p>The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence</p>
<p>And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell.</p>
<p>Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons,</p>
<p>From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild</p>
<p>Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon</p>
<p>And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond</p>
<p>The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines,</p>
<p>And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool.</p>
<p>Peor his other Name, when he entic'd</p>
<p>Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile</p>
<p>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.</p>
<p>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd</p>
<p>Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove</p>
<p>Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate;</p>
<p>Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell.</p>
<p>With these cam they, who from the bordring flood</p>
<p>Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts</p>
<p>Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names</p>
<p>Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male,</p>
<p>These Feminine.   For Spirits when they please</p>
<p>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft</p>
<p>And uncompounded is thir Essence pure,</p>
<p>Nor ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,</p>
<p>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,</p>
<p>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose</p>
<p>Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,</p>
<p>Can execute thir aerie purposes,</p>
<p>And works of love or enmity fulfill.</p>
<p>For those the Race of Israel oft forsook</p>
<p>Thir living strength, and unfrequented left</p>
<p>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down</p>
<p>To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low</p>
<p>Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear</p>
<p>Of despicable foes.   With these in troop</p>
<p>Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd</p>
<p>Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;</p>
<p>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon</p>
<p>Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs,</p>
<p>In Sion also not unsung, where stood</p>
<p>Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built</p>
<p>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,</p>
<p>Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell</p>
<p>To idols foul.   Thammuz came next behind,</p>
<p>Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd</p>
<p>The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate</p>
<p>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,</p>
<p>While smooth Adonis from his native Rock</p>
<p>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood</p>
<p>Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the Love-tale<p>
<p>Infected Sions daughters with like heat,</p>
<p>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch</p>
<p>Ezekial saw, when by the Vision led</p>
<p>His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries</p>
<p>Of alienated Judah.   Next came one</p>
<p>Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark</p>
<p>Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off</p>
<p>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,</p>
<p>Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:</p>
<p>Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man</p>
<p>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high</p>
<p>Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast</p>
<p>Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon</p>
<p>And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.</p>
<p>Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat</p>
<p>Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks</p>
<p>Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.</p>
<p>He also against the house of God was bold:</p>
<p>A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,</p>
<p>Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew</p>
<p>Gods Altar to disparage and displace</p>
<p>For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn</p>
<p>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods</p>
<p>Whom he had vanquisht.   After these appear'd</p>
<p>A crew who under Names of old Renown,</p>
<p>Osiris, Isis, Orus and thir Train</p>
<p>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd</p>
<p>Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek</p>
<p>Thir wandring Gods Disguis'd in brutish forms</p>
<p>Rather then human.   Nor did Israel scape</p>
<p>Th' infection when thir borrow'd Gold compos'd</p>
<p>The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King</p>
<p>Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan,</p>
<p>Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,</p>
<p>Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd</p>
<p>From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke</p>
<p>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods</p>
<p>Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd</p>
<p>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love</p>
<p>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood</p>
<p>r Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee</p>
<p>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest</p>
<p>Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd</p>
<p>With lust and violence the house of God.</p>
<p>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns</p>
<p>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse</p>
<p>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,</p>
<p>And injury and outrage: And when Night</p>
<p>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons</p>
<p>Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.</p>
<p>Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night</p>
<p>In Gibeah, when the hospitable door</p>
<p>Expos'd a Matron to avoid worse rape.</p>
<p>These were the prime in order and in might;</p>
<p>The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,</p>
<p>Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth</p>
<p>Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born</p>
<p>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd</p>
<p>By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove</p>
<p>His own and Rhea's Son like measure found;</p>
<p>So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet</p>
<p>And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top</p>
<p>Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air</p>
<p>Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff,</p>
<p>Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds</p>
<p>Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old</p>
<p>Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields,</p>
<p>And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles.</p>
<p>All these and more came flocking; but with looks</p>
<p>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd</p>
<p>Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief</p>
<p>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost</p>
<p>In loss itself; which on his count'nance cast</p>
<p>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride</p>
<p>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore</p>
<p>Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais'd</p>
<p>Thir fanting courage, and dispel'd thir fears.</p>
<p>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound</p>
<p>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard</p>
<p>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd</p>
<p>Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall:</p>
<p>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld</p>
<p>Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't</p>
<p>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind</p>
<p>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,</p>
<p>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while</p>
<p>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds</p>
<p>At which the universal Host upsent</p>
<p>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond</p>
<p>Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night.</p>
<p>All in a moment through the gloom were seen</p>
<p>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air</p>
<p>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose</p>
<p>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms</p>
<p>Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array</p>
<p>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move</p>
<p>In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood</p>
<p>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd</p>
<p>To hight of noblest temper Hero's old</p>
<p>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage</p>
<p>Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd</p>
<p>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,</p>
<p>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage</p>
<p>With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase</p>
<p>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain</p>
<p>From mortal or immortal minds.   Thus they</p>
<p>Breathing united force with fixed thought</p>
<p>Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd</p>
<p>Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now</p>
<p>Advanc't in view, they stand, a horrid Front</p>
<p>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise</p>
<p>Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,</p>
<p>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief</p>
<p>Had to impose: He through the armed Files</p>
<p>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,</p>
<p>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,</p>
<p>Thir number last he summs.   And now his heart</p>
<p>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength</p>
<p>Glories: For never since created man,</p>
<p>Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these</p>
<p>Could merit more then that small infantry</p>
<p>Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood</p>
<p>Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd</p>
<p>That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side</p>
<p>Mixt with auxiliar Gods;   and what resounds</p>
<p>In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons</p>
<p>Begirt with British and Armoric Knights;</p>
<p>And all who since Baptiz'd or Infidel</p>
<p>Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban,</p>
<p>Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond</p>
<p>Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore</p>
<p>When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell</p>
<p>By Fontarabbia.   Thus far these beyond</p>
<p>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd</p>
<p>Thir dread commander: he above the rest</p>
<p>In shape and gesture proudly eminent</p>
<p>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost</p>
<p>All her Original brightness, nor appear'd</p>
<p>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess</p>
<p>Of Glory obscur'd;   As when the Sun new ris'n</p>
<p>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air</p>
<p>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon</p>
<p>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds</p>
<p>On half the Nations, and with fear of change</p>
<p>Perplexes Monarch.   Dark'n'd so, yet shon</p>
<p>Above them all th' Arch Angel; but his face</p>
<p>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care</p>
<p>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes</p>
<p>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride</p>
<p>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast</p>
<p>Signs of remorse and passion to behold</p>
<p>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather</p>
<p>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd</p>
<p>For ever now to have thir lot in pain,</p>
<p>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't</p>
<p>Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung</p>
<p>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,</p>
<p>Thir Glory witherd.   As when Heavens Fire</p>
<p>Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,</p>
<p>With singed top thir stately growth though bare</p>
<p>Stands on the blasted Heath.   He now prepar'd</p>
<p>To speak; whereat thir doubl'd Ranks they bend</p>
<p>From wing to wing, and half enclose him round</p>
<p>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.</p>
<p>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn,</p>
<p>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last</p>
<p>Words interwove with sighs found out thir way.</p>

<br></br>

<p>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers</p>
<p>Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife</p>
<p>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,</p>
<p>As this place testifies, and this dire change</p>
<p>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind</p>
<p>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth</p>
<p>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,</p>
<p>How such united force of Gods, how such</p>
<p>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?</p>
<p>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,</p>
<p>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile</p>
<p>Hath emptied Heav'n, shall fail to re-ascend</p>
<p>Self-rais'd, and repossess thir native seat?</p>
<p>For mee be witness all the Host of Heav'n,</p>
<p>If counsels different, or danger shun'd</p>
<p>By mee, have lost our hopes.   But he who reigns</p>
<p>Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure</p>
<p>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,</p>
<p>Consent or custome, and his Regal State</p>
<p>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,</p>
<p>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.</p>
<p>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own</p>
<p>So as not either to provoke, or dread</p>
<p>New warr, provok't; our better part remains</p>
<p>To work in close design, by fraud or guile</p>
<p>What force effected not: that he no less</p>
<p>At length from us may find, who overcomes</p>
<p>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.</p>
<p>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife</p>
<p>There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long</p>
<p>Intended to create, and therein plant</p>
<p>A generation, whom his choice regard</p>
<p>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:</p>
<p>Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps</p>
<p>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:</p>
<p>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold</p>
<p>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abyss</p>
<p>Long under darkness cover.   But these thoughts</p>
<p>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,</p>
<p>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr</p>
<p>Open or understood must be resolv'd.</p>

<br></br>

<p>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew</p>
<p>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs</p>
<p>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze</p>
<p>Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd</p>
<p>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms</p>
<p>Clash'd on thir sounding Shields the din of war,</p>
<p>Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav'n.</p>

<br></br>

<p>There stood a hill not far whose griesly top</p>
<p>Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire</p>
<p>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign</p>
<p>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,</p>
<p>The work of Sulphur.   Thither wing'd with speed</p>
<p>A numerous Brigad hasten'd.   As when Bands</p>
<p>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm'd</p>
<p>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,</p>
<p>Or cast a Rampart.   Mammon led them on,</p>
<p>Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell</p>
<p>From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts</p>
<p>Were always downward bent, admiring more</p>
<p>The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,</p>
<p>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd</p>
<p>In vision beatific: by him first</p>
<p>Men also, and by his suggestion taught</p>
<p>Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands</p>
<p>Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth</p>
<p>For Treasures better hid.   Soon had his crew</p>
<p>Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound</p>
<p>And dig'd out ribs of Gold.   Let none admire</p>
<p>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best</p>
<p>Deserve the precious bane.   And here let those</p>
<p>Who boast in mortal things, and wond'ring tell</p>
<p>Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings</p>
<p>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,</p>
<p>And Strength and Art are easily out-done</p>
<p>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour</p>
<p>What in an age they with incessant toyle</p>
<p>And hands innumerable scarce perform.</p>
<p>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd</p>
<p>That underneath had veins of liquid fire</p>
<p>Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude</p>
<p>With wond'rous Art found out the massie Ore,</p>
<p>Severing each kind, and scum'd the Bullion dross:</p>
<p>A third as soon had form'd within the ground</p>
<p>A various mould, and from the boyling cells</p>
<p>By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,</p>>
<p>As in an Organ from one blast of wind</p>
<p>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.</p>
<p>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge</p>
<p>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound</p>
<p>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,</p>
<p>Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round</p>
<p>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid</p>
<p>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want</p>
<p>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,</p>
<p>The Roof was fretted Gold.   Not Babilon,</p>
<p>Nor great Alcairo such magnificence</p>
<p>Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine</p>
<p>Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat</p>
<p>Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove</p>
<p>In wealth and luxurie.   Th' ascending pile</p>
<p>tood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores</p>
<p>Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide</p>
<p>Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth</p>
<p>And level pavement: from the arched roof</p>
<p>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row</p>
<p>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed</p>
<p>With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light</p>
<p>As from a sky.   The hasty multitude</p>
<p>Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise</p>
<p>And some the Architect: his hand was known</p>
<p>In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,</p>
<p>Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,</p>
<p>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King</p>
<p>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,</p>
<p>Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright.</p>
<p>Nor was his name unheard or unador'd</p>
<p>In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land</p>
<p>Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell</p>
<p>From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove</p>
<p>Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn</p>
<p>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun</p>
<p>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,</p>
<p>On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate,</p>
<p>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout</p>
<p>Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now</p>
<p>To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape</p>
<p>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent</p>
<p>With his industrious crew to build in hell.</p>
<p>Mean while the winged Haralds by command</p>
<p>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony</p>
<p>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim</p>
<p>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held</p>
<p>At Pandaemonium, the high Capital</p>
<p>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd</p>
<p>From every Band and squared Regiment</p>
<p>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon</p>
<p>With hunderds and with thousands trooping came</p>
<p>Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates</p>
<p>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall</p>
<p>(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold</p>
<p>Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair</p>
<p>Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry</p>
<p>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)</p>
<p>Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,</p>
<p>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.   As Bees</p>
<p>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides</p>,
<p>Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive</p>
<p>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers</p>
<p>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,</p>
<p>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,</p>
<p>New rub'd with Baum, expatiate and confer</p>
<p>Thir State affairs.   So thick the aerie crowd</p>
<p>Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n</p>
<p>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd</p>
<p>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons</p>
<p>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room</p>
<p>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race</p>
<p>Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves,</p>
<p>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side</p>
<p>Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees,</p>
<p>Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon</p>
<p>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth</p>
<p>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance</p>
<p>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;</p>
<p>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.</p>
<p>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms</p>
<p>Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,</p>
<p>Though without number still amidst the Hall</p>
<p>Of that infernal Court.   But far within</p>
<p>And in thir own dimensions like themselves</p>
<p>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim</p>
<p>In close recess and secret conclave sat</p>
<p>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,</p>
<p>Frequent and full.   After short silence then</p>

<p>
And summons read, the great consult began.
